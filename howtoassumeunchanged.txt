To ignore files and have them
 disappear from git add and git diff
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt 
Apparently this can be undone
by using git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt

Okay! It worked. (Previous bug: in .gitignore there was a line for *.txt.) 

Second line of changes. Will Git assume howtoassumeunchanged.txt is unchanged?
